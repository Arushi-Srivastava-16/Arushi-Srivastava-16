### 🌸 What I Love Building

I'm most alive when I'm turning big ideas into real-world AI tools — the kind that **see**, **listen**, and **respond** to human needs.

Whether it's helping someone *hear the world around them*, *visualize the risk of heatstroke in a city*, or *detect anomalies in breast scans* — I build to solve. But more than that... I build to *connect*.

I'm currently obsessed with:

* 🤖 **Explainable AI** that clinicians can trust
* 🌆 **Digital Twins** to make cities more resilient
* 🌍 **Climate-Aware Simulations** for urban impact
* 🎨 Mixing **creativity** with **code** to tell compelling, meaningful stories

### 🪷 Me, Outside the Terminal

I’m not just a builder.
I’m a **singer**, **painter**, and **nature lover** who finds joy in creating experiences — whether that’s through color, voice, or ideas.

💃 I dance ideas into rhythm.
🎨 I paint thoughts that don't yet have words.
🌿 I find logic in leaves and poetry in patterns.
🔭 I teach kids that space and code are *cool*.

If tech is the *how*, creativity is my *why*.
